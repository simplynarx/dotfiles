It comes with advanced ways to select what links to download, and will remember your previous decisions so that you can queue more downloads with just OneClick!\n\nAdvanced users will also like using renaming masks, which let you automatically assign names (and even sub-folders within your downloads folder), fast-filtering or even custom, re-usable filters.\n\nDownThemAll is open-source and free. We spend a lot of time making it, and keep spending a lot of time improving it, and even fixing some problems in Firefox itself so DownThemAll! can work even better.\nWe will never add adware, spyware, user tracking or other nasty stuff. Therefore we rely on your donations exclusively to fund the development.\n\nWe are looking for people willing to help translate DownThemAll! to more languages. For a small guide on how to do that, please see our preliminary translation guide. You will get our gratitude, and the gratitude of all the users whose live you improved by bringing DownThemAll! to their language.\n\nPlease do NOT report any bugs and issues in the user review section, but file a bug report instead. This is the only way to make sure we actually see it, and it also makes communicating to us/with you a lot easier. Thanks\n\nPlease note: Version 4 of DownThemAll! is.a complete rewrite as a WebExtension, as the old add-on system was abandoned and disabled in Firefox. This was mozilla's decision, and there is nothing we can do about it. We are therefore limited to the tools the WebExtensions model provides to us, which sadly makes it impossible to provide some of the advanced features of DownThemAll! Version 3. Furthermore there are some bugs in Firefox that affect DownThemAll! as well, e.g. downloads will always succeed even if the server returns an error, but I fixed this in upcoming Firefox 71.\nHowever, we're still able to provide the advanced selection, queuing, file naming options of the old DownThemAll!

If you'd like to support the continued development of the extension, please consider contributing with Patreon, PayPal or Bitcoin.\n\nThe extension helps journalists and researchers around the world to verify the authenticity of images, and assists the identification of false information and fake social media accounts. Search by Image is also popular among photographers, helping artists explore how their work is shared on the web, while shoppers find it valuable for discovering similar products at discounted prices.\n\nThe extension enables you to search for images from the context menu and the browser toolbar with the help of a diverse set of reverse image search engines, which can be toggled and reordered from the extension's options. Visit the wiki for the full list of supported search engines.\n\nhttps://github.com/dessant/search-by-image/wiki/Search-engines\n\nImages positioned at the selected area are detected regardless of how they were embedded in the page.

The search mode can be set independently for the context menu and browser toolbar from the extension's options.\n\nSearch modes:\n\n    Select: select an image on the page, then search for the image URL. Blob, data and file URLs will still be handled as image uploads. This is the default search mode.\n    Select & Upload: select an image on the page, then fetch the image, possibly from the browser cache, and upload it. This search mode is preferred for sites which do not allow direct linking of images, such as private sites.\n    Capture: select and capture a page area, then upload it.\n    Upload: select an image from your device, then upload it.\n    URL: search for an image URL.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Search with a single engine, or all enabled ones, directly from the top-level context menu item, or the browser toolbar button (see options)\n    Detect any image on the page, including those declared in CSS and pseudo-elements\n    Select the desired image from a dialog, when multiple images are found\n    Search for images from private sites (see search modes)\n    Search for local images (see search modes)\n    Search for the current video frame\n\n\nRequired permissions:\n\n    Access your data for all tabs and websites: required for parsing web pages and performing image searches\n    Display notifications: needed for displaying error messages\n\n\nThe context menu item is always visible, unless it is disabled. Visit the wiki for more details.\n\nThe image you select during a search is sent to the requested third-party service, such as Google Images. Visit the extension's privacy policy for more information.\n\nKnown issues:\n\n    The context menu API is not available on Android, use the extension from the browser menu instead (1595822)\n\n\nThe extension is also available for Chrome and Edge.\n\nReviews are not monitored for bug reports, please use GitHub for issues and feature requests.\nhttps://github.com/dessant/search-by-image","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230000.png?modified=1622132702","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230000.jpg?modified=1622132702","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230001.png?modified=1622132704","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230001.jpg?modified=1622132704","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230002.png?modified=1622132706","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230002.jpg?modified=1622132706","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230003.png?modified=1622132707","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230003.jpg?modified=1622132707","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230004.png?modified=1622132709","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230004.jpg?modified=1622132709","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230005.png?modified=1622132711","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230005.jpg?modified=1622132711","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/230/230006.png?modified=1622132713","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/230/230006.jpg?modified=1622132713","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/dessant/search-by-image","supportURL":"https://github.com/dessant/search-by-image/issues","contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=GLL4UNSNU6SQN&utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.652,"reviewCount":187,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search_by_image/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":5471,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3815277/search_by_image-3.7.1-an+fx.xpi","updateDate":1627300451000},{"id":"sponsorBlocker@ajay.app","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590937-32.png?modified=d215907f","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590937-64.png?modified=d215907f","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2590/2590937-128.png?modified=d215907f"},"type":"extension","name":"SponsorBlock - Skip Sponsorships on YouTube","version":"2.1.2.1","creator":{"name":"Ajay Ramachandran","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13499177/"},"developers":[],"description":"Easily skip YouTube video sponsors.

All that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed—that is exactly what ClearURLs does.\n\nAnother common example are Amazon URLs. If you search for a product on Amazon you will see a very long URL, such as: https://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct/ref=sxin_0_pb?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&keywords=tea&pd_rd_i=exampleProduct&pd_rd_r=8d39e4cd-1e4f-43db-b6e7-72e969a84aa5&pd_rd_w=1pcKM&pd_rd_wg=hYrNl&pf_rd_p=50bbfd25-5ef7-41a2-68d6-74d854b30e30&pf_rd_r=0GMWD0YYKA7XFGX55ADP&qid=1517757263&rnid=2914120011\n\nIndeed most of the above URL is tracking code. Once ClearURLs has cleaned the address, it will look like this:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/exampleProduct\n\nWhy use this extension as opposed to similar ones?\nMost other “link cleaners” employ about a dozen rules when looking for tracking parameters to remove. ClearURLs utilizes over 250 rules, so its capabilities are more comprehensive.\nAnd ClearURLs is open source, so everyone can join in to the project and/or can check the source code to error or malicious code.\n\nAll functions in a nutshell\n\n    Removes tracking from URLs automatically in the background\n    Blocks some common ad domains (optional)\n    Has a built-in tool to clean up multiple URLs at once\n    Supports redirection to the destination, without tracking services as middleman\n    Adds an entry to the context menu so that links can be copied quickly and cleanly\n    Blocks hyperlink auditing, also known as ping tracking\n    Prevents ETag tracking\n    Prevents tracking injection over history API\n    Prevents Google from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n    Prevents Yandex from rewriting the search results (to include tracking elements)\n\n\nWhat do we collect?\nThis extension protects and respects your privacy.
